# beforeSend Testing Playground

> Test Sentry `beforeSend` transformations across multiple SDKs before deploying to production

## Overview

**Learn by doing.** The beforeSend Testing Playground lets you experiment with real Sentry SDKs in a safe sandbox environment. Load pre-built examples, see transformations in action with visual diffs, and master `beforeSend` patterns across 9 languages—all before touching production. Perfect for Solutions Engineers impressing customers with live demos and building deep SDK expertise.

**Key Features:**
- ✅ Test with real Sentry SDKs (JavaScript, Python, Ruby, PHP, Go, .NET, Java, Android, Cocoa)
- ✅ **16 pre-built example templates** across 9 SDKs
- ✅ **Diff viewer** - See side-by-side comparison of original vs transformed events
- ✅ Monaco editor with syntax highlighting
- ✅ Docker-isolated execution (safe for arbitrary code)

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Clone and navigate to the repository
cd beforesend-playground

# 2. Build and start all services
docker-compose up -d

# 3. Open the playground
open http://localhost:3000
```

The playground will be available at **http://localhost:3000** 🎉

### Stop Services

```bash
docker-compose down
```

## Using the Playground

### 1. Load an Example (Recommended)

Click **"Load Example"** to browse **16 pre-built templates**:
- PII Scrubbing (JavaScript, Python, .NET, Ruby)
- Conditional Event Dropping (JavaScript, PHP, Go)
- Custom Tags & Context (JavaScript, Java, Cocoa)
- Custom Fingerprinting (JavaScript)
- Unity Metadata Cleanup (Android)
- iOS Lifecycle Tags (Cocoa)
- And more!

See **[Example Templates Guide](docs/examples.md)** for full catalog.

### 2. Or Write Your Own

1. Paste a Sentry event JSON (or use the default)
2. Select your SDK (JavaScript, Python, Go, etc.)
3. Write your `beforeSend` callback
4. Click **"Transform"** to see the result

### 3. Review Changes

- **Full Output** tab: See the complete transformed event
- **Diff View** tab: Side-by-side comparison with color-coded changes
  - 🟢 Green = Added/Modified
  - 🔴 Red = Removed/Original

See **[Diff Viewer Guide](docs/diff-viewer.md)** for details.

### 4. Copy & Deploy

Copy your tested `beforeSend` code to your Sentry SDK configuration.

## Real-World Example

**Problem:** Android Unity crashes include device metadata in the exception message, making issue titles unreadable.

**Before:**
```
Type: UnityException
Value: FATAL EXCEPTION [RxComputationThreadPool-1] Unity version : 6000.2.14f1 Device model : samsung SM-A022M Resources$NotFoundException: File resource not found
```

**After:**
```
Type: Resources$NotFoundException
Value: File resource not found

Tags: thread: RxComputationThreadPool-1, device_model: samsung SM-A022M
```

**Solution:** Load the "Unity Metadata Cleanup" example from the templates library, or see **[full example](docs/examples.md#unity-metadata-cleanup)**.
