# Sentry SDK Playground

> A multi-mode testing platform for Sentry SDK features across 12 languages

## Overview

**Learn by doing.** The SDK Playground is a comprehensive testing platform for Sentry SDK features. Test event transformation callbacks, sampling strategies, filter patterns, webhook integrations, and configuration analysis—all in a safe sandbox environment. With **8 specialized testing modes**, **50+ pre-built examples**, and support for **12 SDK languages**, you can master Sentry integration patterns before touching production.

**Key Capabilities:**
- **8 Testing Modes** - beforeSend, beforeSendTransaction, beforeBreadcrumb, tracesSampler, webhooks, config analyzer, API query tester, pattern tester
- **12 SDK Languages** - JavaScript, Python, Ruby, PHP, Go, .NET, Java, Android, Cocoa, React Native, Rust, Elixir
- **50+ Example Templates** - Real-world patterns for PII scrubbing, sampling, filtering, and more
- **Visual Diff Viewer** - Side-by-side comparison of original vs transformed data
- **Real-time Validation** - Catch syntax errors before execution
- **Secure Sharing** - Share configurations with automatic PII scrubbing

## Quick Start

**Requirements:** Docker & Docker Compose (that's it!)

```bash
# 1. Clone and navigate to the repository
cd sdk-playground

# 2. Build and start all services
docker-compose up -d

# 3. Open the playground
open http://localhost:3000
```

The playground will be available at **http://localhost:3000**

### Choose Your Mode

| Mode | Purpose | Use When |
|------|---------|----------|
| **beforeSend** | Transform error events | Scrubbing PII, adding tags, filtering errors |
| **beforeSendTransaction** | Transform performance data | Filtering health checks, adding context |
| **beforeBreadcrumb** | Filter navigation/console logs | Reducing noise, scrubbing URLs |
| **tracesSampler** | Dynamic sampling rates | Cost optimization, critical endpoint prioritization |
| **Webhooks** | Test webhook integrations | Debugging signature verification |
| **Config Analyzer** | Validate SDK configuration | Reviewing Sentry.init() setup |
| **API Query Tester** | Test search queries | Building API integrations |
| **Pattern Tester** | Test filter patterns | Validating ignoreErrors/denyUrls |

## Mode Overview

### beforeSend Mode

Transform error events before they are sent to Sentry. Use it to:
- Scrub PII (emails, IPs, tokens)
- Add custom tags and context
- Filter noisy errors
- Modify exception values

**Example:**
```javascript
(event, hint) => {
  // Redact sensitive user data
  if (event.user?.email) {
    event.user.email = '[REDACTED]';
  }
  return event;
}
```

### beforeSendTransaction Mode

Transform transaction events before sending. Use it to:
- Drop health check transactions
- Add business context
- Modify transaction names
- Filter by endpoint

**Example:**
```javascript
(transaction, hint) => {
  // Drop health check transactions
  if (transaction.transaction === 'GET /health') {
    return null;
  }
  return transaction;
}
```

### beforeBreadcrumb Mode

Filter and modify breadcrumbs before they're added to events. Use it to:
- Drop noisy console logs
- Scrub tokens from URLs
- Categorize breadcrumbs
- Reduce breadcrumb volume

**Example:**
```javascript
(breadcrumb, hint) => {
  // Drop console breadcrumbs
  if (breadcrumb.category === 'console') {
    return null;
  }
  // Scrub tokens from navigation URLs
  if (breadcrumb.data?.to) {
    breadcrumb.data.to = breadcrumb.data.to.replace(/token=[^&]+/, 'token=[REDACTED]');
  }
  return breadcrumb;
}
```

### tracesSampler Mode

Implement dynamic sampling strategies for performance monitoring. Use it to:
- Sample critical endpoints at higher rates
- Drop health checks entirely
- Implement user-based sampling
- Optimize tracing costs

**Example:**
```javascript
(samplingContext) => {
  const name = samplingContext.transactionContext.name;

  // Always sample payment endpoints
  if (name.includes('/payment')) {
    return 1.0; // 100%
  }

  // Never sample health checks
  if (name === 'GET /health') {
    return 0.0; // 0%
  }

  return 0.1; // 10% default
}
```

**Output:** Visual sampling rate indicator showing the percentage and what portion of transactions will be sent vs dropped.

### Webhooks Mode

Test Sentry webhook payloads with HMAC-SHA256 signature generation and verification. Use it to:
- Debug webhook integrations
- Test signature verification code
- Inspect webhook payload structures
- Demonstrate webhook security to customers

**Available Templates:**
- Issue Alert - Created/Resolved/Assigned
- Metric Alert
- Error Event
- Comment Created

### Config Analyzer Mode

Analyze and validate Sentry.init() configurations. Use it to:
- Validate configuration syntax
- Understand what each option does
- Get SE-focused recommendations
- Identify potential issues

**Supported SDKs:** JavaScript, Python, Ruby, PHP, Go, .NET, Java, Android, Cocoa

### API Query Tester Mode

Test and validate Sentry API search queries. Use it to:
- Validate query syntax in real-time
- Get property suggestions for typos
- Execute queries against real data
- Generate ready-to-use cURL commands

**Example Queries:**
```
is:unresolved level:error
assigned:me
level:fatal age:-24h
!user.email:*@internal.com
```

### Pattern Tester Mode

Test ignoreErrors, denyUrls, and allowUrls filter patterns. Use it to:
- Validate regex patterns before deployment
- Test patterns against sample inputs
- Generate Sentry.init() configuration code
- Understand pattern matching behavior

**Pattern Types:**
- **ignoreErrors** - String/regex patterns for error messages
- **denyUrls** - URL patterns to exclude from error reporting
- **allowUrls** - URL patterns to include (whitelist mode)

## Sharing Configurations

Share your configurations securely with colleagues or customers:

1. Configure your event/code in any mode
2. Click the **Share** button
3. Copy the generated URL (expires after 30 days)

**Security:** Event values are automatically scrubbed before sharing. Only the structure (field names and types) is preserved, along with your code.
